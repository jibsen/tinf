About
-----

tinf is a small library implementing the decompression algorithm for the
[deflate][wpdeflate] compressed data format (called 'inflate'). Deflate
compression is used in e.g. zlib, gzip, zip, and png.

I wrote it because I needed a small in-memory zlib decompressor for a self-
extracting archive, and the zlib library added 15k to my program. The tinf
code added only 2k.

Naturally the size difference is insignificant in most cases. Also, the
zlib library has many more features, is well-tested, and mostly faster.
But if you have a project that calls for a small and simple deflate
decompressor, give it a try :-)

Usage
-----

The include file `src/tinf.h` contains documentation in the form of
[doxygen][] comments.

Wrappers for decompressing zlib and gzip data in memory are supplied.

tgunzip, an example command-line gzip decompressor in C, is included.

tinf uses [CMake][] to generate build systems. To create one for the tools on
your platform, and build tinf, use something along the lines of:

~~~sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
cmake --build . --config Release
~~~

You can also compile the source files and link them into your project. CMake
just provides an easy way to build and test across various platforms and
toolsets.

Notes
-----

The inflate algorithm and data format are from 'DEFLATE Compressed Data
Format Specification version 1.3' ([RFC 1951][deflate]).

The zlib data format is from 'ZLIB Compressed Data Format Specification
version 3.3' ([RFC 1950][zlib]).

The gzip data format is from 'GZIP file format specification version 4.3'
([RFC 1952][gzip]).

The original version of tinf assumed it was given valid compressed data, and
that there was sufficient space for the decompressed data. If code size is
of the utmost importance, and you are absolutely sure you can trust the
compressed data, you may want to check out [tinf 1.1.0][tinf110] (last
release without security checks).

Ideas for future versions:

  - Memory for the `tinf_data` object should be passed, to avoid using more
    than 1k of stack space
  - Wrappers for unpacking zip archives and png images
  - Blocking of some sort, so everything does not have to be in memory
  - Optional table-based Huffman decoder
  - Small compressor using fixed Huffman trees
